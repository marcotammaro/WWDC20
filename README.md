# WWDC2020
This is my WWDC2020 project, it's a PlaygroundBook to get people interested in the world of computer components not by disassembling perfectly working PCs (maybe this is not the best idea), instead by using a Playground Book to let them interact with a simplified version of a computer. At a first glance, a PC could seem hard to understand and because of this, we could lose interest in this wonderful and exciting topic. My aim is to use my knowledge to guide you step by step, raise your curiosity and, most importantly, teach how something we use every day is made.

That is what I am trying to accomplish with “What’s in my PC”, a project aimed to help people to learn about computers and to love them as much as I do.

I hope you appreciate my idea.
Thank you for your attention.
