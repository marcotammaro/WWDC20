 # The Motherboard
 
 Hey, welcome in the first component, it's called motherboard and maybe it's the most important component in your PC, it **coordinates** all the other elements of the PC and allows them to interact with each other.
 
 To understand the future components of this book we need to understand the **main zone** that form a motherboard:
 
 1. The **socket** of the CPU (ðŸŸ¥ frame).
 
 2. The **RAMs slot** (ðŸŸ¨ frame).
 
 3. The **PCI Express slot** (ðŸŸ¦ frame).
 
 - Note:
Complete and run the code and **tap** in the **colored frames** to see more details.
